# Welcome to 'Plainly Speaking'
## A personal blog by Darrell Mayson

### Minima default theme for Jekyll - not so straight forward!

Have finally located SASS files for 'minima' in /home/dazza/.rbenv/versions/2.3.1/lib/ruby/gems/2.3.0/gems/minima-2.1.1/_sass/minima.

Other useful files located at /home/dazza/.rbenv/versions/2.3.1/lib/ruby/gems/2.3.0/gems/minima-2.1.1/
