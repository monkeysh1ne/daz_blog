## Why some mobile & web app designers get it wrong [imho]

My mobile phone provider doesn't just want to provide me with a mobile application for managing my mobile services on my Android phone.  They want to share thier excitement at how terrific thier app is.  Loading screens with splash comments like "Do do do, almost loaded!" And "App successfully loaded!"  Contrast this with the strictly business notifications advising "Your data binge session has finished.  Normal data usage and charges now apply."  Why not "Oh poo! Your data binge has expired!  Still feel like bingeing?"  Several points I want to make.

As with any communication you need to pick a style and stick with it.  Otherwise you're sending mixed messages.  TBH I'd feel happier with my mobile provider going with strictly business.  I didn't sign up for a new friend.  I don't think to myself "Yay!  My application loaded!" when I fire an app up on my phone.  Of course the fucking thing loaded.  Otherwise it wouldn't be on my phone in the first place.

> Of course the fucking thing loaded.  Otherwise it wouldn't be on my phone in the first place.

This brings me to my second point - all apps should just work, and well.  They should address a customer's need quickly and efficiently with an intuitive, easy to use interface and a minimium of clutter.  Once this objective is met you *might* consider adding some nice-to-have's.  My [mobile service] provider app doesn't perform well.  Sometimes I can be waiting over 30 seconds for it to update my usage data.  You know - the stuff I'm most interested in.  This results in a negative user experience at my end.  I get pissed off while I wait for the damn app to do what is most important/urgent for me.

My last point is this - don't push notifcations out to your user via other channels (in this case SMS) without giving them some way to manage this; a way to opt out of recieing these for example.  My provider sends messages for *everything* - data binge started, data bnige about to expire, data binge ended, combo about to expire, credit low, data all used..  These messages are sent both from within thier app *and* via SMS.  So yeah, that's fucking annoying.

  So now I'm experiencing stress because..
- I have to have thier app to manage my data use [especially] but also my text and call usage.
- The chummy messages while the app performs key functions (loading and updating user stats) only inflame my negative feelings while I wait for my expectations to be met - i.e., quick loading and quick statistics updates.
- I have no means of managing what notifications I recieve both through the app and through the text messages it sends.
