## Why Individual Effort Can Be Destroyed In An Under-Performing Team

Forging a winning team is like creating a winning plate of food..
1. consider the desired taste and texture of the final product,
1. assemble the right ingredients,
1. blend and season said ingredients for proper balance and cohesion,
1. assemble according to plan [menu] and,
1. plate professionally for a pleasure to the eye and palate.

Just throwing random ingredients together and applying random processes to them will not likely yield a pleasant result.  So why do it?  This flawed logic seems to pervade the business community in New Zealand.  The resulting 'dish' is predictably bitter on the tongue and unpleasant to the eye.  So why does the practice continue?

> manager/owners fail to apply a considered approach to what business needs their new appointments address, so no analytics can be applied to measure success or failure

Before looking at this further I think it's productive to consider just how damaging this practice is and it's multiple effects..
- individual staff are appointed at the cheapest rate possible so they feel under-valued from the get go.
- new staff are unlikely to bring the bargaining accumen or negotiating weight to thier initial meeting with management to assure a quality contract outcome when securing thier new role.
- manager/owners fail to apply a considered approach to what business needs their new appointments address, so no analytics can be applied to measure success or failure in what thier new staff members bring to the table.
- as staff are added to the roster there is unlikely to be any consideration given to 'team fit' - new appointees are added to the existing staff roster without considering..
	- how thier values will gel or clash with those of existing staff
	- how thier personal goals can be assessed & met by the business
	- how thier circumstances might influence the business culture.
- many manager/owners operate thier business without the benefit of professional mentoring or business management skills - they just don't *know* how or why group dynamics can effect thier business for good or ill.
- many individuals suffer the same handicap when seeing themselves within a [new] organisation.

#### At the risk of labouring a point let's illustrate how this approach is geared to failure by offering an example that I think is typical in the current New Zealand employment market:
1. John owns & manages a civil contracting company and has done for some 8 years.  It's net worth is in the $500k - $2m range including plant, exising staff and current contracts value.
1. John needs more staff due to increasing pressure to meet contract deadlines.
1. John approaches the state and private sector to screen and deliver possible candidates based on the following criteria:
	- physically fit
	- few (or better) no criminal convictions
	- endorsements to operate existing plant/machinery
	- good references from previous employers
1. John meets with the available candidates as offered following initial screening and produces his 'top-5' list of preferred candidates.
1. John considers his top-5 and, after some wrangling, offers employment to those he thinks will work at the rates he is happy to pay.

All good so far right?  Well yes.  And no.  Whilst John has certainly covered the basics what he *hasn't* is at least as important to his business.  What are the key motivations/drivers for his new staff?  What are possible career development paths for them?  How well do thier values and attitudes gel with those of John and his existing staff?  What behaviours will the new staff bring into thier roles?  Will these compliment the business or work to it's detriment?  What sort of longevity will John be getting from his new and existing staff as a result of behavioural/values clashes or compliments amongst staff?


> Whilst John has certainly covered the basics what he *hasn't* is at least as important to his business.

Hire for values, train for skills.  Solid advice and a worthy credo to work to.  But how often does this advice get followed in the New Zealand business arena?  Check out any given want ad on any given day.  You'll see an introduction crowing the success of the hiring company and perhaps speaking to it's vision.  Then you'll see a list of key *skills* required from any applicants as well as prerequisite experience.  Hiring managers *may* touch on what values and behaviours would be employees might bring to the role.  It is unlikely that the hiring manager will know if any new appointees will clash or be at odds in thier beliefs and values and behaviours from those of existing staff - it's not a skillset that many hiring managers have TBH.  Likewise hiring managers will not likely discuss possible career paths or if they do it's simply a 'hook' to draw the potential hire into agreeing to join the company.

So where does this leave our example company and it's owner, John?  He appoints a couple of new guys who bring the requisite skills.  One is a little young and green but full of energy and drive.  The other more mature and with a broader skillset.  In time the older guy feels he is carrying most of the crew as he is the go-to guy for most of the work John is undertaking.  And why not? - John hired him for those very skills so he would hit the ground running.  Unfortunately the other side of this coin is that older guy feels he is not being afforded a chance to develop his own career path to grow and develop his skills in new directions.  The young guy has brought friction into the team as the existing members don't hold to his cultural mores and beliefs as well as feeling he isn't listening or taking on board their advice.  The young guy feels he's being looked down on and not respected by other members of the team.  He also feels that he is not being developed as quickly as he thought he would in the hiring interview.  John meanwhile hears complaints coming up through his operations manager and foreman but is helpless to form a plan to address issues.  He simply doesn't *know* how to treat them outside of the professional misconduct framework within his employment contracts. 

> Net result - unhappy staff, poor performance within the team, friction amongst staff members, poor work output..

Net result - unhappy staff, poor performance within the team, friction amongst staff members, poor work output,  high staff turnover and a reputation in the market for poor quality work and high staff turnover.  John cannot compete on quality so he is forced to compete on price.  Staff become harder to find so he is forced to bottom-dredge for less skilled and or cheaper staff.  Those staff that might have served as mentors have left John's company for better prospects elsewhere.

With such clear costs in terms of time energy and money maintaining staff why on earth would any business adopt this approach?  It seems to this author that with a little extra effort and commitment there are far better ways to plan for success in the business world.  What do you think?  Feedback and comments, as usual, welcome.
