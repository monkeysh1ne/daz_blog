Is there anything more stressful than dealing with a frail/inflated ego?  My workmates seem to share a common need to..
1. belittle others in order to elevate temselves and 
1. promote themselves endlessly to crow thier successes (percieved or actual)

At first these behaviours comes across as playful banter but after prolongued exposure they reveal thier true nature: the little boy who fears he will lose face in front of his peers whilst needing reassurance that he is in fact the worlds best [...]

Feeding into this insecurity is the pack mentality that seems to pervade labouring gangs.  I've worked in and around these for several years now and continue to be appalled at just how starkly this behaviour contrasts with my experience in the office environs I have spent the bulk of my professional career in.

Not only does this whole 'big dog' mindset exist amongst crew members from labourers to foremen/supervisors but further up the organisational chain into management.  It is both actively supported through management behaviours and communications and passively through allowing workplace physocological/verbal/physical bullying without reprocussions to the perpetrators.

I was recently horrified to learn that a young colleague was physically beaten by my foreman following a work end of year function in response to his (the young guys) repeated verbal baiting of his colleagues.  He was then forced to remain in the vehicle transporting his fellow team mates home following the function for a 50km plus journey - crying the entire time.  

Now I wouldn't expect a workmate to escape without consequence if his playful verbal sparring crossed a line and became hurtful to it's recipient or the wider audience (as was reportedly the case).  But there are appropriate ways to adddress this situation and clearly **inappropriate** ways to do so.  Taking the workmate aside and giving him a verbal warning that the behaviour is unacceptable and may lead to negative/undesireable consequences such as reporting to management might be one example.  Taking said workmate aside and physically asaulting him is clearly **not** an appropriate course of action. 

That the forman should consider this action acceptable shows a marked lack of self control and leadership skill to say nothing of his disregard for the potential legal ramifications of his actions.  I can only hope that one of the other (several) crew members in the vehicle will persue this matter with management or that the boy himself will do so.  Sadly I doubt that either will happen and it is far more likely that the boy will simply resign from his job for shame/humiliation/fear and look to employment elsewhere.
