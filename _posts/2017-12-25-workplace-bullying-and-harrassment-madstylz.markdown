## Background
I joined Madstylz Trenching Ltd in August 2017 as an STMS/Labourer.  The work was, for me, hard physical labour but I gave it my best and sought to make a meaningful contribution to the success of the team I worked with and the company at large.

I was encouraged and proud to have my employer increase my hourly wage rate in response to my successful completion of my STMS-L1 ticket.  I enjoyed the comradery of my workmates and participated in after hours drinks and social gatherings in an effort to consolidate a positive bond with the guys I worked with.

The team dynamic included a fair amount of good-natured 'ribbing' but I came to accept this was not meant in a malicious way and happily gave as good as I got; always mindful that my remarks or jests should never cause offence or discomfort to the recipient and alert to any signs that the recipient was not recieving my jests as intended.

## When the Harrassment/Bullying started.
With the resignation of 3 members of the team for various reasons the company brought in 3 replacement staff.  Adjustments were made by existing staff and for my part I did what I could to welcome the new members.  1 new staff member, Tamiti, however was quick to show negative behaviours to me at a time when our usual foreman, Wiremu Rameka, was away for a week on leave.  When, as part of a new site setup, I asked Tamiki to read and sign our 'Job Start' form - the legally required safety document required to be discussed and agreed upon and signed by *all* personnel entering and or working within our worksites.

Tamiti became agressive and upset complaining that he needed just one set of instructions from one person and saw my request as contrary to those he had recieved from the stand-in foreman, Warrick Stevens.  Tamiti refused to listen to my attempt to explain why the document needed to be read and signed befor we commenced work.  I suggested we bring into the discussion Warrick and Grayson (a representative of our client - Broad Spectrum Ltd) to help explain what I was asking and look to a solution.  Both supported my attempted explaination and further explained to Tamiti the importance of this process/document.  Tamiti eventually calmed down and signed the document.

On another occassion some time later (a few days) during an early morning Stop/Go operation involving Warrick, Tamiti and myself I greeted Tamiti with a "Good Morning" as soon as he arrived at our Otaki Depot.  Tamiti walked past me without a word to which I prompted "Don't I get a Good Morning?".  To this Tamiti responded "I don't say good morning to a two faced cunt who doesn't want to work with me.  That's not part of my job."  I did not respond to this beyond sharing this exchange with Warrick and discussing how we might get the job best done allowing for this aggressive behaviour on Tamiti's part.  As soon as Wiremu was on site I took him aside and reported verbally what had been said and asked that he address the matter with Tamiti as (my words) "I don't need this sort of static."  I likewise took the General Manager, Ross Kelly, aside on *his* arrival on site with the same stated desire (ie., that the matter be dealt with).

## Ongoing exposure to harrassment/bullying
I have repeatedly been assurred that Tamiti has been spoken to and cautioned against further behaviours of this nature.  And still, he (Tamiti) continues with verbal put downs in front of my team-mates - comments such as "There's only 1 person here who needs to earn his pay"[^1].  Many of the jibes and put-downs are in front of other staff, including Wiremu, and sometimes at volume sufficient for the public to hear.  These barbs will often include scornful laughter or non-verbal hooting/screeching.  It is clear that these are not intended as good natured joking.  It is also clear that the behaviour is ongoing.

Although the animosity of Tamiti to me is clear to all in the team and management I still find myself working with sometimes just Tamiti and one other worker.  I have been advised to "just ignore him" and "don't respond to him".  This has resulted in growing stress on my part culminating in my beginning my Christmas holiday break a day early as the previous day had pushed me to my emotional limit; I commented at the time to Warrick (whom I was then working with on site) that I was "..over it.  If he's man enough to harrass me then he should be man enough to stop it and apologise."  Warrick's response was that it was just one more day to go and that I should 'lighten up.'[^2]

Add to my current high levels of stress around this daily exposure to bullying and harrassment I am very concerned that Wiremu and Tamiti have both been to my house and have both shown inclinations to violence and violent behaviour.[^3] The two are (I believe) related as cousins - something I feel has worked against my being dealt a fair hand in this matter. As such I feel cannot reasonable address this workplace bullying and harrassment situation further as provided for under current NZ employment law  as doing so would, I feel, put me at serious risk of reprisal at home.

## Proposal
I would like to respectfully propose that I be allowed to resign with 2 weeks notice and be paid out rather than have to work this period out.  This will allow me to immediately concentrate on finding alternative paid employment without further exposure to Tamiti and his behaviour or additional stress from persuing this matter whilst continuing to work for Madstylz.  I would also appreciate an assurance that this matter will not negatively impact on any future request for a verbal employer reference from yourself or Ross during my ongoing job search.
