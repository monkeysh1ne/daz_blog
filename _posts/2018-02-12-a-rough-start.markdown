## Bad News Comes In Threes?

So the year started with me back on the unemployment line.  It was a roller-coaster ride with WINZ/MSD - some interactions remarkably smooth, some teeth-gratingly difficult.  One thing I have learnt though is that energy spent attempting to sway these government agencies from thier position/policy is an utter waste of time and energy.  You might as well convince the sun that a west/east traverse of the sky is a better option.

Family relations improved immeasurable with time spent with sister and niece/nephew.  Many months of absence melted away and several visits enjoying each other's company and spending time left me feeling very positive and warm.

> As the remnants of my final pay dwindled and died the harsh reality of a subsistence (at best!) existence re-asserted itself in late January.  Regular bank payments towards power were nixed.  Two weeks rent sought as special need from WINZ.  Two requests for extra funds to help with food.  Credit on phone wasn't garaunteed.  Home internet - yeah right!

The final challenge was presented in the week ending 11-02-18 when my landlady calls to say the house is going on the market.  I may get lucky and they find an investment buyer who agrees to keep me on.  I may have no such luck and the Otaki rental market is **tough**.  So yeah, things are a little stressful.  I dare to even consider it but the only thing that would likely send me over the edge into serious depression/stress would be contact form my WINZ Work Broker asking how the job hunt is going.  It's not.

I have a temp job coming up over mid to end of Feb and possibly into March but beyond that zip.  I am *not* returning to civil or traffic.  My last four (count em!) jobs have involved workplace bullying/harassment to one degree or another and personally I'm **way** over that shit.  Doing a hum drum job that doesn't provide any enjoyment or fulfilment is one thing.  Turning up to be heckled, harrassed, persecuted, micro-managed, mocked and generally treated like shit is **not** something I'm letting myself open to - and civil/traffic is rife with that sort of behaviour.
