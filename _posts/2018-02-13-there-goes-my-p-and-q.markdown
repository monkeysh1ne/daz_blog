## Or, When Your Landlady Goes Into Overdrive

It's amazing how swiftly and surprisingly things are changing around me lately.  What was once my sanctuary, my place of quiet privacy and solace has been invaded.  It all started..

..with a phone call about a week back from my landlady - "..really sorry but I have to put the house on the market as I'm in hock to my dad for several grand for a failing business venture."  Ok so I've taken a little liberty by summarising here but that's the gist of it.  Ok, well **that sucks** but I guess I just gotta roll on and adapt to this new development.  Maybe it'll sell to an investment buyer and they'll agree to keep me on.  Maybe it won't sell at all.  Maybe I'll win the lottery and get that warehouse styled penthouse suite I've always wanted.

Alas this telephone call was only the beginning of the impact this development would have on my life.
 > Consider: I am a bit of a home body and change is not as easy as it used to be for me in my younger years.  Consider also - the [rental] housing market in Otaki, a place I now consider my *home* and a place I really want to stay, is pretty ratshit right now for a single guy.

I am now being beseiged by a seeming raft of people who need to do yard work (weed-eater), compile a property review (wandering through house taking notes), undertake a building inspection (as with property review but includes slamming things, moving furniture/personal items), water-blast the exterior..all this after text-snippets sometimes on less than 24hrs notice from my landlady.  As someone who really **values** his quiet and privacy this is a major impedement.

And to think that I thought being out of work and struggling to deal with **that** was going to be the biggest hurdle I'd be facing in my immediate future.  Ho boy!

Aside: During my almost 5 years tennancy I have paid rent on time, looked after the property and not complained about the odd minor defects; including sagging concrete slabs at the front entrance, a leaking downpipe at the front door, rotting windows that don't seal on several of the front and side windows, lack of house insulation.  Despite several inspections by my landlady she has failed to address these as they arose *out of these inspections* (and in spite of law changes recently mandating ceiling and under-floor insulation by July 2019!)  To my mind they were just a small price to pay for a mostly hands-off tennancy where I could just reside in comfort and security knowing that if I continued to respect and uphold my side of the agreement all would be well.

> Gotta say, I have never seen so much *activity* in and around the property as when my landlady needs fast cash to remedy a personal cash crisis.  So much for my (clearly mis-guided) sense of solidity and security. Bugger!
