## Or, when enough is enough webdev technology

I love watching what's happening in the web & software development spheres.  Back in the day it was HTML.  Then CSS came along.  Meanwhile connectivity had moved along to 14.4kps, 28.8, 56, 56v2!  Things were **crankin!**  Netscape Navigator was giving Internet Explorer a run for it's money and I was just thrilled to be watching girly pics download line by line and flirting like crazy on tem bulletin boards.

Time rolls on and neck minute there's server side scripting and PHP vs ASP.Net.  And what's this business about Java, C, C++?  What's that all about?  Tinker, tinker.  Several tutorials and books later and a bunch o' not really good for anything programmes stashed away on my PC o-the-day.
