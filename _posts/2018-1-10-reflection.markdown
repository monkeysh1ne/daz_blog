## Looking forward/backward

There was every intention of goodness.  Every desire to do the right thing, for the right reason, to the right end.  I never sought out failure.  Never have.  I have not failed.

The end is not a judgement against me.  It is a failure of those for whom money is paramount.  For whom poor choices, compromised ethics and shallow hearts require human sacrafice to the god Mammon.  For whom greed is prime and all else simply a means to an end.
